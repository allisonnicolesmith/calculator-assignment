        <p>Despite the economic recession as a result of the pandemic, many American households have stockpiled money, with overall savings totaling $2.41 trillion in February, up from $1.38 trillion last February. The average individual retirement
          balance hit a new record. </p>

        <p>According to data from Fidelity, which analyzed retirement savings trends in the fourth quarter of 2020 across more than 30 million 401(k), IRA, and 403(b) accounts, the average 401(k) balance reached $121,500 at the end of 2020, an 8
          percent increase from the year before and up from 11 percent from the previous quarter. IRA balances hit $128,100, an 11% spike from last year’s $115,400 average and a 9% jump from the quarter before. The typical 403(b) account balance saw
          a record, too: It rose 10% from last quarter to $106,100 and hit six figures for the first time.</p>

        <p>Fidelity researchers studied account balances and contributions and found that one in three individuals increased their 401(k) contributions in 2020, buoyed even further by employer contributions. </p>

        <p>The trend underscores the unevenness of the economic recovery, with some Americans struggling because of pandemic-related unemployment or other loss of income, while others work in industries that have been able to adapt in spite of the
          pandemic. </p>

        <p>A significant number of Americans have struggled financially throughout the pandemic. Overall, three in 10 people said they’ve decreased how much they’re setting aside for retirement or stopped saving altogether, according to an August
          FinanceBuzz survey. Another survey, from MagnifyMoney, found 30% of adults had pulled an average of $6,757 out of their retirement account because they lost a job or needed extra cash.</p>

        <p>Experts stress that if you are making less now because of the pandemic, then you should prioritize the essentials like food and housing over retirement and other savings. But if you are in a position to do so, now is a fortuitious time to
          take advantage of increased savings from spending less on dining out, travel, and entertainment, and put extra funds toward retirement savings. </p>
